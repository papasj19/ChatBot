# KBS - Chatbot

by Spencer Johnson
on June 2023

The following explanation is in conjunction with the KBS final project

The goal was to create a chatbot from zero while learning different operating procedures during development. By using tools such as Natural Language Processing, Sentiment Analysis and external databases we are able to build upon the plan laid out in the first phases that allow for this project to take third in voting and allow me to obtain an 8.25/10 in the class.


## Included Software

The project has been broken up into two different parts, the first conatains the planning of the chatbot. The first phase is a report that explains the general details of a chatbot and this is followed by a conceptual presentation in phase 2 that uses code and presentation. Phase two is roughly what the TheChatbot (Phase Three) actually is. The second half, named TheChatBot, uses all the tools required and is paired with the knowledge of the shortcomings of phase two, allowed for development of a fun project.
